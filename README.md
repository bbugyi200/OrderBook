# OrderBook

My attempt at designing a data structure which efficiently tracks limit orders (i.e. bids and asks).

### Unit Tests
The corresponding unit tests were written using Python's [pytest] testing framework. All tests can be run using the following command:
```
python2 -m pytest test_order_book.py
```
